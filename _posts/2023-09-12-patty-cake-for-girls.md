I have an infant daughter. She loves Patty Cake (or [Pat-a-cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat-a-cake,_pat-a-cake,_baker%27s_man)). Here is my version:
<br>

*Patty cake, patty cake, bakers girl.*


*Bake me a cake that’s out of this world.*


*Roll it and pat it and mark it with a B,*


*And put it in the oven for Baby and me!*


*Yay! Baby!*
