I have an infant daughter. She loves Patty Cake (or [Pat-a-cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat-a-cake,_pat-a-cake,_baker%27s_man)). Here is my version:

> Patty cake, patty cake, bakers girl.
>
> Bake me a cake thatâ€™s out of this world.
>
> Roll it and pat it and mark it with a B,
>
> And put it in the oven for Baby and me!
>
> Yay! Baby!

<p>Here is a nursery rhyme:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,</li>
		<li>Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,</li>
		<li>All the king's horses and all the king's men,</li>
		<li>Couldn't put Humpty together again.</li>
	</ul>
{% endraw %}
