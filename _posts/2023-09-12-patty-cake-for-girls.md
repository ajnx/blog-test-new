I have an infant daughter. She loves Patty Cake (or [Pat-a-cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat-a-cake,_pat-a-cake,_baker%27s_man)). Here is my version:

[The following HTML uses Wikipedia's page source as an example of how to properly markup a nursey rhyme.]: # 

<dl>
	<dd>Patty cake, patty cake, bakers girl.</dd>
	<dd>Bake me a cake thatâ€™s out of this world.</dd>
	<dd>Roll it and pat it and mark it with a B,</dd>
	<dd>And put it in the oven for Baby and me!</dd>
	<dd>Yay! Baby!</dd>
</dl>
