I have an infant daughter. She loves Patty Cake (or [Pat-a-cake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat-a-cake,_pat-a-cake,_baker%27s_man)). Here is my version:

*Patty cake, patty cake, bakers girl.*

*Bake me a cake thatâ€™s out of this world.*

*Roll it and pat it and mark it with a B,*

*And put it in the oven for Baby and me!*

*Yay! Baby!*
